### 1️⃣ Magic Number Guess  
🔹 **Concepts**: Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`), `if` statements  

👉 **Question:**  
Write a Python program where the user enters a number. If it’s **42**, print **"You found the magic number!"**. If it's **greater than 42**, print **"Too high!"**. If it's **less than 42**, print **"Too low!"**.

### 2️⃣ Super Speed Test  
🔹 **Concepts**: Arithmetic operators (`*`, `/`), comparison, `if-elif-else`  

👉 **Question:**  
A superhero can run **5 times** faster than a normal human. Write a program that asks for a person’s running speed.  
- If their speed is greater than `25` (5 × normal human speed), print **"You're a superhero!"**  
- If their speed is **exactly** `25`, print **"You just made it!"**  
- Otherwise, print **"Keep training!"**

### 3️⃣ Odd or Even Mystery  
🔹 **Concepts**: Modulus operator (`%`), `if-else`  

👉 **Question:**  
Ask the user to enter a number. If it's even, print **"This is an even number!"**. If it's odd, print **"This is an odd number!"**.

### 4️⃣ Monster Battle Power  
🔹 **Concepts**: Arithmetic operators, comparison  

👉 **Question:**  
A monster has **attack power** and **defense power**. Ask the user to enter both values.  
- If **attack** is **double** or more than defense, print **"The monster is super strong!"**  
- If attack is **equal** to defense, print **"It's a fair fight!"**  
- Otherwise, print **"The monster is weak!"**

### 5️⃣ Secret Code Challenge  
🔹 **Concepts**: Logical operators (`and`, `or`), `if` statements  

👉 **Question:**  
Ask the user to enter a **secret code**.  
- If the code is **"PYTHON" or "SNAKE"**, print **"You unlocked the treasure!"**
